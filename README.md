Here's a list of phones I've come across with a metric shitton of carrier bloatware on them. Sadly, you can't unlock their bootloaders and put a better ROM on them.

But, they're pretty good phones, Brent. So just debloat them before use with these handy lists.

ADB debug, and run 'python carrier_debloat.py [list_for_your_phone]' -- that's all.
